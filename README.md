This is a simple GET API call example with real world scenario. When we want to retrieve multiple data items from the DB and list them in our mobile application, we send a GET request from the app that targets the concerned backend API.

## Functionality

(1) A parent component to List all the items (online courses) including a function that makes the API call. (2) A child component to create reusable individual items.

Note: As it's an example, only a limited number of data properties are used for simplicity - there can be many more and with complex structure.
